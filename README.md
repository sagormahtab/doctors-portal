# Doctors Portal

Check the live site here [Doctors Portal](https://doctors-portal-fnp.netlify.app/)

This is kind of a hospital management web app. Here a patient can book an appointment for a specific date. When the patient choose a date he can see all the appointments available for that specific day. Such as
- Teeth Orthodontics
- Cosmetic Dentistry
- Cavity Protection
- Teeth Cleaning etc

After booking the appointment by filling up the required form the user data would be placed in a database. 

## How would the doctor manage the patients?
The doctors will get a dashboard interface in the website. In the dashboard they will be able to see all the appointed patients, pending patient and etc. Then the doctor can add or view a prescription for a specific patient.
